## Neural Network For Faces

Implementation of neural network based on Tom Mitchell's book Machine Learning(chapter 4).

It recognizes some features of faces such as:
1. sunglasses or open (~90% correctly)
2. expression: happy, sad, neutral, angry(~25% correctly)  
3. direction: straight, up, left, right(~95% correctly)

Pictures must be in gray scale. Sample data can be taken from https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mitchell/ftp/faces.html.
